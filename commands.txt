Recommendations:
Set Memory Overcommit:
Run the following command to set the memory overcommit:

bash```

echo "vm.overcommit_memory = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```
Consider Rootless Mode:
If you're concerned about security, consider setting up Docker in rootless mode using:

bash```

dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
```
